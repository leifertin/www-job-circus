			Job-circus Terms of Service ("Agreement")
			</p>
			<p style="font-style:italic;">
			This Agreement was last modified on November 10, 2015.
			</p>
			<p>
			Please read these Terms of Service completely using job-circus.com which is owned and operated by Grayson Leif Heflin. This Agreement documents the legally binding terms and conditions attached to the use of the Site at job-circus.com.
			</p>
			<p>
			By accessing and using this service, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement. In addition, when using these particular services, you shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services. Any participation in this service will constitute acceptance of this agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not use this service.
			</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
			Intellectual Property Rights
			</p>
			<p>
			The Site and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Grayson Leif Heflin and are protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.
			</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
			Accepted payment methods
			</p>
			<p>
			Job-circus currently only accepts payments through Paypal. This is to ensure security on both ends. Any provided financial information is processed only through Paypal and is never stored or accessible to the employees or users of Job-circus. The only time payment will be addressed is when an employer decides to post a job listing. Workers will never be asked to pay for any services.
			</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
			Posting A Help Wanted
			</p>
			<p>
			When an employer posts a help wanted it has an expiration date of 30 days. The posting will not be visible to others until it is published. The employer has an option to use a coupon to publish the listing for free or pay using PayPal. The cost when using PayPal is $4.99 USD. Upon publishing, the expiration date resets and will expire 30 days from the publish date.
			</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
			Refund policy
			</p>
			<p>
			Employers are entitled to a full refund within 7 days of purchase. While it is not required to provide a reason for a refund it is optional. The 7 day limit is enforced to prevent abuse of the system. All refunds are processed through Paypal to ensure a secure and trusted transaction on both ends.
			</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
			Termination
			</p>
			<p>
			We may terminate your access to the Site, without cause or notice, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your account. All provisions of this Agreement that, by their nature, should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

			What Personal Information We Collect
			</p>
			<p>
			Job-circus collects your personal information when you voluntarily provide it to us. If you choose to register, we ask you to provide limited personal information, which differs depending upon wether you sign up as a worker or as an employer.

			As a worker we ask you to provide your name, current city and state, phone number, wether or not you have access to transportation, if you can legally work in the United States, your availability (days or nights), a short description of yourself, email, and password. We also ask you to provide as much or as little of a job history and educational history as you want to provide. All of the information you provide stays securely within a database on Job-circus and is never sold or given away to a third-party. The purpose of collecting said information is only to provide interested employers routine resume details for hiring prospective employees. It can be used to contact you and/or determine eligibility for available jobs. Whatever information you provide, is visible only to employers who have listed jobs which you have applied to. Your email is also requested in order to login and reset your password, should you forget it. Your password is never stored in plain text; It is encrypted. We cannot retrieve your password should you forget it. Your account and all information associated with it can be deleted at any time by you, the user.
			</p>
			<p>

All of the information you provide stays securely within a database on Job-circus and is never sold or given away to a third-party. The purpose of collecting said information is only to provide interested workers routine job listing details for any jobs you have posted. Your business phone number and email are requested in order to allow a prospective employee to contact you about a job. Your email is requested in order to receive notifications when an applicant has applied to one of your postings.

			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
			Cookie Placement
			</p>
			<p>
			Job-circus, like many other commercial sites, may use a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a website operator determine that a particular user had visited the site previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set. We may use cookies to keep track of information about your current web browsing session which will be discarded as soon as you log out or close your web browser. This information also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose. We may also make use of “persistent or memory based” cookies, which remain on your computer’s hard drive until you delete them. Although you have the ability to modify your browser to either accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize our services if you reject cookies.

			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
			How We Protect Information Online
			</p> 			<p style="margin-top:-1em;">
			We exercise great care to protect your personal information. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as SSL, encryption, and intrusion detection. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via email since we have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us since email does not have the security features that are built into our websites.
			</p>
			<p>
			In addition, we limit Job-circus’ employees and contractors' access to personal information. Only those employees and contractors with a business reason to know have access to this information. We educate our employees about the importance of maintaining confidentiality of customer information.
			</p>
			<p>
			We review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate.
			</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
			How can you help protect your information?
			</p>
			<p>
			If you are using the Job-circus website for which you registered and choose a password, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of the Job-circus website and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if others have access to your computer.
			</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
			Notification
			</p>
			<p>
			The company reserves the right to change these conditions from time to time as it sees fit and your continued use of the site will signify your acceptance of any adjustment to these terms. If there are any changes to our privacy policy, we will announce that these changes have been made on our home page and on other key pages on our site. If there are any changes in how we use our site customers' Personally Identifiable Information, notification by email or postal mail will be made to those affected by the change. Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on our site 14 days prior to these changes taking place. You are therefore advised to re-read this statement on a regular basis.
